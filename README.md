# GoogleSearch
This is an updated version to suite Python 3.x execution environments

The original code can be found at https://pypi.org/project/google-search/#description or https://github.com/anthonyhseb/googlesearch but it is not suitable for Python 3.x. I have modified it slightly to suit the new syntax in Pyhton 3.x. Please let me know if you find any issues with this code when using with Python 3.x.
